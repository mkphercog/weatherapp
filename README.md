# Weather app

This application uses data from API Open Weather Map to check weather in every town in the world.

## If you want you can copy this app, for that use command:

```
git clone https://github.com/mkphercog/weatherapp
```

## In this project I'm using:

- redux
- axios
- preprocessor SASS with methodology BEM
